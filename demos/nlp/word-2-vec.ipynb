    "## Training word-to-vec embeddings\n",
    "When it comes to embeddings, the most common use case is to **download pre-trained embeddings** and employ these for some downstream tasks (with or without fine-tuning). The Keras *embedding layer* supports that use case very well, as we will see in a future demo on sentiment analysis. Since this demo aims at deepening our understanding of W2V, we focus on a different use case and demonstrate the training of **customer word embeddings** using our IMDB data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You could argue that the IMDB forum exhibits a specific type of speech or jargon, and that this justifies training word embeddings for this specific corpus. In practice, using pre-trained embeddings will almost surely give better results than training embeddings from zero. However, without going into too much detail of the pros and cons of pre-training your own embeddings versus employing pre-trained embeddings, perhaps with some finetuning, the point of this section is simply to showcase how you could train from scratch if you want to. To that end, we will use a library called `Gensim`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Gensim` is a popular library for text processing. Although maybe even more geared toward topic modeling, it offers, among others, implementations of several algorithms to learn word embeddings including *W2V*, *GloVe*, and *Fasttext*. We demonstrate training W2V embeddings using our cleaned IMDB movie review data set. Before moving on, make sure to have installed `Gensim`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Credits and disclaimers**: many of the examples you are going to see in this section have been inspired by this very nice [Kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pierremegret/gensim-word2vec-tutorial/notebook)."

    "Training word embeddings using `Gensim` is very easy and just a matter of calling a function. Well, the reason it takes so little code is that we have already cleaned our data and have it available as an array of texts; that is a format that `Gensim`supports. However, note that, depending on your data, the code may take quite a while to run. Again, word embeddings trained on the full 50K data set for 500 epochs are available in our course folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim is build for scalability. Would we use a large corpus, it were not be practical to first load all data from disk into your computer's main memory, to then process the data document by document using Gensim. Instead, it would be much more scalable to stream the data from disk. Long story short, we need a bit of infrastructure to input our review data set, which, for simplicity, we keep in a data frame, in a way that complies with what Gensim expects.  into. To that end, we build a little helper class that facilitates streaming reviews from our data frame. It would be easy to extend the helper class so as to facilitate streaming reviews from disk, or support both options. The [Gensim documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_word2vec.html#training-your-own-model) provides an example."

It would train one embedding for new and another for york, provided both words are part of the vocabulary. You can get better embeddings by adding common phrases to the vocabulary. W2V will then train individual embeddings for these phrases. Gensims also comes with a phrase detection models, which allows you to handle bigrams, trigrams and the like. We will not retrain our W2V model but sketch how you can use Gensim to get these common phrases. You could then consider to add (some of) them to your vocab and enhance the model.  "

    "### Plotting word vectors\n",
    "It is fairly easy to create a visualization of the trained word vectors. You can find an example of how to do this in the [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/pierremegret/gensim-word2vec-tutorial) mentioned above. Needless to say, many alternative demos are available online; here is just [one example](https://www.kaggle.com/jeffd23/visualizing-word-vectors-with-t-sne). However, to get meaningful results we would need to prepare the data more carefully by, for example, removing too frequent words and too infrequent words. We would also finetune the training, and, overall, invest a lot more work to craft our word embeddings. In practice, we would typically not train our own embeddings from scratch. Instead, we would download pre-trained embeddings, which are available in many flavors (multiple languages, trained on different corpora with different jargon, etc.), and use these in our NLP application. We could also finetune the pre-trained embeddings using our own text data. We will showcase a corresponding approach in a later notebook on sentiment analysis. "
