    "Pre-processing textual data is a standard task. Several Python libraries including `scikit-learn` and `Keras` offer similar functionality. We will use the `NLTK toolkit` in this notebook. It has a clear and easy to understand syntax and is well-suited to demonstrate standard NLP operations. Although not the focus of this tutorial, we also introduce a library called `Beautiful Soup`, which gained a lot of popularity in web-scraping. Make sure to have these libraries installed before running the following codes. \n",

The idea is that if we have a large corpus many words will appear multiple times in different grammatical forms. Still, the meaning that these words carry is roughly identical. Running, run, ran, runner, etc. all of these words indicate that the text has something to do with running. Assuming that this is all we need to know -- yes that is a bold assumption -- stemming makes sense as it could greatly reduce the number of distinct words in a corpus. This number of distinct words, also called **vocabulary size**, is very important. It effects the efficiency of NLP operations and may also have a big impact on the accuracy of text classification. <br>\n",

We conclude this part by putting all of the above steps into a helper function, which we will use later in the session to clean a data set of online movie reviews. Our helper function will use lemmatization instead of stemming because it is likely to give better results in downstream tasks (i.e., text classification). The following function is yet another helper to call the lemmatizer with the right dictionary form of a word.   "

We use a version from Kaggle, which includes 50K reviews and binary labels whether a review is positive or negative. The labels are useful for sentiment analysis, which we will do in our next programming session. Here, we simply prepare the data for the next session and thereby further elaborate on the NLP operations introduced in the previous part.

I've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film. <br /><br />The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.\""

I expected a popcorn monster flick and a mildly diverting way to spend a late night but instead a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart. <br /><br />This is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them, and it is filmed like you are there and it is really happening. I know some people in other reviews compare it to \"Open Water\", but I disagree because I thought Open Water was quite boring and mediocre, while this movie was the opposite, although superficially they are filmed in the same \"realistic\" style.<br /><br />The actors are unknowns, at least to me, but they all are very effective and convey the dire situation with frightening intensity and realism. The story is well done and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and appears to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think about. Very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it.<br /><br />I had tears in my eyes at the end. I must say a movie seldom has this effect on me, this is how powerful and emotional this movie was done and I am suitably impressed by the director and actors of this great movie.\n",

    "Strictly speaking, the session is over. We covered the fundamental steps in a NLP pre-processing pipeline. You can easily skip the remainder of the notebook, in which we demonstrate one way to train word vectors using word-to-vec (W2V). When it comes to embeddings, the most typical use case is to **download pre-trained embeddings** and employ these for some downstream tasks (with or without fine-tuning). Keras supports that use case very well, as we will see in the next session. At times, however, you may want to **train your own embeddings**. For example, our data is from IMDB. People talk about movies. Maybe they use a specific type of language that is not well represented in pre-trained W2V embeddings. Without going into too much detail of the pros and cons of pre-training your own word embeddings, the point of the following codes is simply to showcase how you can do it if you want to. We will use a library called `Gensim`.\n",

Although maybe even more geared toward topic modeling, it offers, amongst others, implementations of several algorithms to learn word embeddings including *W2V*, *GloVe*, and *Fasttext*. The following demonstrates training W2V embeddings using the cleaned reviews. Before moving on, you might need to install `Gensim`  ;)   "

However, note that, depending on your data, the code may take quite a while to run. Again, word embeddings trained on the full 50K data set for 500 epochs are available in our course folder."

The examples are inspired by [this Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/pierremegret/gensim-word2vec-tutorial). If you want to visualize the trained word vectors have a look at [this post](https://www.kaggle.com/jeffd23/visualizing-word-vectors-with-t-sne). It is fairly easy to create a visualization but to get meaningful results you would need to prepare the data more carefully; for example removing too frequent words and too infrequent words. Ultimately, working with the embeddings would involve building a proper NLP model and using it to solve some downstream tasks, as we will do in the next session. The following codes simply showcase the embeddings and functionality of `Gensim`."
